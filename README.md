Hands-on codes and practice materials for the online course https://www.udemy.com/sql-for-newbs
I take no credit for the online course mentioned in the link above. I am a student of this course.
This Repository is a placeholder for all the hands-on and practice stuff that comes with the course. 

These exercises and small queries are very much relevant to real scenarios. All the examples work with Sakila dB which is a database(probably fictional, I am not sure!) for a video rental company. The exercises tend to answer typical questions asked in a business setting by the marketing guys or the senior members or the bosses. 
Ex:
1. Which is the best selling movie or the least selling movie? - Take decisions accordingly - Fill the shelves with more of movies that sell well and get rid of the other ones, probably.
2. Which customers are most valuable? - Try to retain them, understand their liking, send them promotional emails to retain them, award them for their loyalty
3. Who are the customer driving our revenues? - Try to retain them, understand their liking, send them promotional emails to retain them. Think about how you can increase other customers.
4. How does the revenue per movie look like? - Get a break-up of revenues per movies and take decisions accordingly
5. Who is an inactive month? - Send emails, promotional offers to those who are inactive.
6. Which store is most profitable? - Identify the not profitable stores and see if any special attention is needed to these stores.
and many more
